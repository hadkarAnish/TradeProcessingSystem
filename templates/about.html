<h2>What is Trade Processing?</h2>
<p>When a client wants to buy a stock from the market, he interacts with his broker to buy it from the stock exchange. The bid from the broker is placed, received by the exchange which matches the customer with a counterparty. Post-trade processing occurs
    after a trade is complete. At this point the buyer and the seller compare trade details, approve the transaction, change records of ownership, and arrange for the transfer of securities and cash. In addition to matching the details of the buy and
    sell orders, post-trade processing includes shifting records of ownership and authorizing payment. This successful trade is then reported back to the exchange, clearing houses and other parties for record keeping.</p>
<h2>Why Trade Processing?</h2>
<p>Investors take up trading as a career or a source of generating additional income. Post-Trade services have recently come to the forefront as a means for financial firms to diversify their revenue streams. Due to a combination of new regulations, the
    standardization of derivatives, and increased need for more complex processing measures, due to the growth of alternative assets, post-trade services is an area, in which some firms have a chance to outstrip competitors.</p>
